To setup a local http server,

1. Open the folder containing required html files.
2. python3 -m http.server
# On windows try "python" instead of "python3", or "py -3"

3. By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. 
You can go to this server by going to the URL localhost:8000 in your web browser. 
Here you'll see the contents of the directory listed â€” click the HTML file you want to run.

Note: If you already have something running on port 8000, you can choose another port by running the server command followed by an alternative port number, 
e.g. python3 -m http.server 7800 (Python 3.x) or python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7800 (Python 2.x). You can then access your content at localhost:7800.
